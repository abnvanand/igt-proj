Team 5

Strategy:
Bid high on the first day even if we have a loss in order to gain in terms of quality score.
On subsequent days, if a campaign's budget is 0.1 it means that we lost on the previous day.
So we increase a factor quadratically and this factor is multiplied to our bids before submission on the next day.
We tried exponential, linear and quadratic functions. Quadratic seems to perform the best.
This factor is adjusted on a per day basis depending on whether previous day's campaign was won or lost.
We have also applied a GREED factor which tells how greedy we are in terms of winning the bid.
The greed gets accumulated over losing days and it increases and thus lets us make winning bids.
Whenever the segment to be reached is broad(eg MALE or FEMALE_HIGH_INCOME) we bid on all possible sub segments
dividing the total budget proportionately this proportion depends on the user distributions and is available in
`MarketSegment.proportionsMap`.
